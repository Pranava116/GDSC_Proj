# karthik_proj

## Project Overview

This project is a simple Flask application that uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to generate text based on user prompts.  The primary purpose is to demonstrate a basic integration with Google's Gemini API.  The target user is any developer wanting to quickly understand how to interface with and leverage the Gemini language model for text generation.


## Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Framework:** Flask
* **API:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API
* **Libraries:** `requests`, `flask_cors`, `dotenv`
* **Environment Variables:** `.env` file for API key management


## Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Python 3.7+:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Pip:**  Make sure pip (Python package installer) is installed.
3. **Virtual Environment (Recommended):** Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd karthik_proj
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Create a `.env` file:**  Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```
   **Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key.**  Obtain this key from the Google Cloud Console after setting up a Gemini project.

## Usage Guide

**Running the application:**

1. **Start the Flask development server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Send a POST request:**  The application accepts POST requests to the `/generate` endpoint with a JSON payload containing the prompt.

   **Example using curl:**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Write a short poem about a cat."}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate
   ```

   **Expected Response (JSON):**

   ```json
   {
     "generated_text": "A furry friend, a purring sound,\nA whiskered face, upon the ground,\nWith emerald eyes, so softly bright,\nA feline grace, a wondrous sight."
   }
   ```

**Production Deployment:**  This example is designed for local development. For production, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI and a production-ready web server such as Nginx.  You will also need to handle environment variables appropriately in a production setting.

## Features

* **Gemini API Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API for text generation.
* **Error Handling (Retry Logic):** Includes retry mechanism for API requests.
* **CORS Enabled:** Allows cross-origin requests for easier integration with front-end applications.
* **Environment Variable Support:**  Uses environment variables for API key security.


## Codebase Walkthrough

**Folder Structure:**

* **app.py:** The main application file containing the Flask app and Gemini API interaction logic.
* **.env:**  (Hidden file) Stores the Gemini API key.  This file should be added to your `.gitignore` file.
* **requirements.txt:** Lists project dependencies for easy installation.


**Important Files:**

* **`app.py`:**  Contains the Flask application setup, route definition (`/generate`), and the function `call_gemini` which makes the request to the Gemini API, includes retry logic, and handles the response.


## API Documentation

**Endpoint:** `/generate`

**Method:** `POST`

**Request:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "Your text prompt here"
}
```

**Response (Success - 200 OK):**

```json
{
  "generated_text": "The text generated by Gemini API"
}
```

**Response (Error - e.g., 500 Internal Server Error):**

```json
{
  "error": "An error occurred"
}
```
