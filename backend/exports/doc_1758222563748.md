## Karthik's Gemini Language Model Project Documentation

This document details the Karthik project, a Flask application leveraging Google's Gemini language model for text generation.

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Flask application that interacts with the Google Gemini language model API to generate text based on user-provided prompts.  The application handles potential API errors with retries and provides a JSON-based interface.  It uses environment variables for secure API key management.


### Installation/Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask flask-cors requests python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file:**  This file should contain your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (by default).  The port can be changed within the code if needed.


### Tech Stack

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Flask:** A lightweight web framework for creating the API.
* **Flask-CORS:** Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for easier integration with other applications.
* **Requests:** Used to make HTTP requests to the Gemini API.
* **Python-dotenv:** For securely managing environment variables.
* **Google Gemini API:** The core language model used for text generation.


### Feature List

* **Text Generation:**  The primary function is to generate text from a given prompt using the Gemini API.
* **Error Handling:** Implements retry logic to handle potential API failures.
* **Environment Variable Configuration:**  Uses `.env` files for secure API key management.
* **JSON Response:** Returns generated text as a JSON object.


### Code Architecture

The application is built around a single Flask app (`app.py`).  The main functionality is encapsulated in the `call_gemini` function:

* **`call_gemini(prompt, max_retries=5)`:** This function sends a POST request to the Gemini API with the given prompt. It includes retry logic with exponential backoff (the delay doubles after each failed attempt) to handle transient network issues or API rate limits.  It returns the generated text from the Gemini API response.  If all retries fail, it will not return anything.  Error handling would need to be explicitly implemented within the main application (error handling is absent from the current example code).


### Usage Examples

The application is designed as a RESTful API.  To generate text, send a POST request to `/` with a JSON payload containing the prompt.  Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Write a short story about a robot learning to love."}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

The response will be a JSON object containing the generated text:

```json
{
  "generated_text": "Write a short story about a robot learning to love." // Replace with the actual generated text
}
```

Note:  The provided code lacks a specific endpoint to handle this request; it will currently return a 405 error.  A proper API endpoint would need to be added.


### APIs or Functions Explained

* **`call_gemini(prompt, max_retries=5)`:**
    * Takes a `prompt` (string) as input.
    * Makes a POST request to the Gemini API.
    * Includes error handling with up to `max_retries` attempts.  Increases delay exponentially on failed attempts.
    * Returns the generated text (string) from the Gemini API response or `None` if all retries fail.  Error details are not currently returned.
    * Uses `requests` library for HTTP communication.
    * Uses exponential backoff to handle potential API errors.


**Improvements Needed:**

* **Error Handling:** The `call_gemini` function needs more robust error handling to catch and report specific exceptions (e.g., network errors, API errors, invalid JSON responses) and return appropriate error codes.
* **API Endpoint:**  The application needs a properly defined Flask route (`@app.route`) to handle POST requests and return the generated text in a structured JSON format.
* **Input Validation:** The application should validate the input prompt to prevent injection vulnerabilities and ensure that the request is properly formatted.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to avoid exceeding Gemini API usage limits.
* **Logging:** Add logging to track requests, responses, and errors for debugging and monitoring.
